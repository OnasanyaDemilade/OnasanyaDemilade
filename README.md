I am a student in the Department of Geography at the [University of Lagos, Akoka](https://unilag.edu.ng/). My research interests include Geographic Information Science (GIS), remote sensing, and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial big data, machine learning, and cloud computing (e.g., [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)) to study environmental change, especially surface water and wetland inundation dynamics.
